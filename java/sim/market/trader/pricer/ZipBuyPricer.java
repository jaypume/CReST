	 * 
	 * q = last shout price in the market
	 * p = the traders price
	 * 
	 * For Sellers:
	 *   - if (the last shout was accepted at price q) ## NOTE: For an OrderBook, a sell order that executes is equivalent (for ZIP) to a bid shout that is accepted.
	 *      1. any seller s_i for which p_i<q should raise its profit margin
	 *      2. if (the last shout was a bid)
	 *         then
	 *         1. any active seller s_i for which p_i >= q should lower its margin
	 *   - else
	 *      1. if (the last shout was an offer)
	 *      then
	 *         1. any active seller s_i for which p_i >= q should lower its margin
	 *         
	 * For Buyers:
	 *    - if (the last shout was accepted at price q)
	 *       1. any buyer b_i for which p_i>=q should raise its profit margin
	 *       2. if (the last shout was an offer)
	 *          then
	 *          1. any active buyer b_i for which p_i<=q should lower its margin
	 *    - else
	 *       1. if (the last shout was a bid)
	 *          then
	 *          1. any active buyer b_i for which p_i<=q should lower its margin 
	 * 
	 * see http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/97/HPL-97-91.pdf
	 * 
	 * Adaptation:
	 * Shout price p_i(t) for unit j with limit lambda_{i,j}, using profit-margin /mu_i(t):
	 *    p_i(t) = lambda_{i,j}(1+/mu_i(t))
	 * For sellers, /mu_i(t)\in[0,\infty)
	 * For sellers, /mu_i(t)\in[-1,0]
	 * 
	 * Update rule for profit margin, \mu_i:
	 *    \mu_i(t+1) = (p_i(t) + \Delta_i(t)) / \lambda_{i,j} - 1
	 * where \Delta_i(t) is the Widrow-Hoff delta value, calculated using the individual trader's 
	 * learning rate \Beta_i:
	 *    \Delta_i(t) = \Beta_i( \tau_i(t) = p_i(t))
	 * and target price \tau_i(t):
	 *    \tau_i(t) = \R_i(t)q(t) + \A_i(t)
	 * where \R_i is a random var that sets target price relative to the price q(t) of the last shout,
	 * and \A_i(t) is a (small) random absolute price alteration.
	 * When the intention is to increase the shout price: \R_i>1.0 and \A_i > 0.0;
	 * When the intention is to decrease the shout price: 0.0 < \R_i < 1.0 and \A_i < 0.0
	 * 
	 * Every time the profit margin is altered, the target price is calculated using newly-generated random values of \R_i and \A_i.
	 * 
	 * Update rule used for ZIP traders:
	 *    \mu_i(t+1) = (p_i(t) + \Gamma_i(t)) / \lambda_{i,j} - 1
	 * 
	 * where \Gamma_i(t+1) = \gamma_i\Gamma_i(t) + (1-\gamma_i)\Delta_i(t)
	 * 
	 * \R_i~U(1.0,1.05) for price increases, and \R_i~U(0.95,1.0) for price decreases
	 * \A_i~U(0.0,0.05) for price increases, and \A_i~U(-0.05,0.0) for decreases
	 * 
	 * \Beta_i~U(0.1,0.5), initialised with the trader at time t=0
	 * Initial values of \mu_i~U(0.05,0.35) for sellers and ~U(-0.35,-0.05) for buyers: thus all traders begin with profit margins between 5 and 35 percent
